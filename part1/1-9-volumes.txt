touch text.log && docker run --rm -d -v "$(pwd)"/text.log:/usr/src/app/text.log devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service

# If a previous mount failed (possibly due to WSL2 error because I forgot to create the text.log in the host directory, or any other reason), 
I navigated to "/mnt/wsl/docker-desktop-bind-mounts" and deleted everything in there in order to get the command above working 
(otherwise you cannot make it run no matter the command).
